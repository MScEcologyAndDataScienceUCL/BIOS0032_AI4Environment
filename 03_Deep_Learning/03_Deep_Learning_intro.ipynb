    "## Background on Deep Learning Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Like for other machine learning models, there exist a number of libraries that allow you to\n",
    "implement deep learning models easily. For Python, some of the most popular ones are:\n",
    "1. [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (by Meta/facebook; we will use it in all of this course)\n",
    "2. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) (by Google)\n",
    "3. [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (an ecosystem that supports deep learning frameworks\n",
    "   among other mathematical implementations)\n",
    "4. [Keras](https://keras.io/) (not a dedicated deep learning library itself, but a high-level layer\n",
    "   on top of PyTorch, TensorFlow or Jax)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many others, but not all are still maintained (or as professionally done as these). Since\n",
    "deep learning is a very fast moving idea, it is highly recommended to use proper and up-to-date\n",
    "frameworks like the ones mentioned above. These will allow you to do anything reliably, from\n",
    "learning over prototyping and doing research to implementing deep learning-based apps for your\n",
    "computer or smartphone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For completeness, the following deep learning libraries have been _deprecated_ and should not be\n",
    "used anymore: Apache MXNet, Microsoft CMTK, Caffe, Theano.\n",

    "You might be disappointed to see that all of the above, including lots of coding, hyperparameter\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what's the big deal with deep learning?\n",
