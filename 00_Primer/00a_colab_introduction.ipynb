    "RMarkdown if you know that. The default programming language is Python, but you can also run R with\n",
    "an extension (we'll see that in the second half of the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a Web/cloud-based infrastructure using Jupyter\n",
    "Notebooks (like the one you're reading now) and providing free access to compute resources for a\n",
    "limited time. This is convenient, but you don't really need Colab to run Notebooks; you can also do\n",
    "so on your own computer, another server, _etc._.\n",
