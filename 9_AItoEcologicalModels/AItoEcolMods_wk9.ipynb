    "For this, we’ll mainly use the “terra” package (and sometimes its predecessor, “raster”; there is a nice introduction and code examples [here](https://rspatial.org/pkg/index.html)). A raster is essentially a big matrix with geographical information associated with each grid cell. Like sf objects, it has a coordinate reference system that links each cell’s XY coordinates with a geographic location. Just like other spatial objects, these follow a particular map projection to map coordinate values to a location on the spherical earth. As in this workshop, these are stored in standardised formats such as GeoTiffs. We’ll start by reading, plotting and exploring some rasters of habitat class across the Masai Mara."

    "Next, we’ll extract information about the habitat surrounding each sampling site. Our habitat raster (`hab`) is at fine resolution (30m), so extracting the value only in the grid cell the point falls in might be less useful to describing the overall habitat conditions in surrounding area. To deal with this, we can create a buffer around each point (a circular polygon with a user-defined radius, e.g. 250 metres) and then average the habitat conditions within that local area. When we are developing our modelling pipeline, we can think about what size of buffer might be most relevant and how this maps onto our species. Experiment with the code below to see what it looks like when we change the width of the buffer around each camera trap. Note: the units of “dist” in `st_buffer` are the units of its coordinate reference system, which might be metres, or might be degrees long/lat - make sure you check this when you are doing your own projects, and plot the buffers to make sure they’re doing what you think!"
