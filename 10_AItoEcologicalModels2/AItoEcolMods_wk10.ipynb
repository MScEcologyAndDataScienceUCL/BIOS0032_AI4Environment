We will explore fitting and evaluating some generalised linear models, before exploring how extending our models to include nonlinear and geospatial effects can improve our ability to infer ecological drivers.

    "Let's start with a broad question: what is the relationship between level of anthropogenic pressure and spatial occupancy of our focal species? We can define anthropogenic pressure in many ways, but here, let's focus on livestock pressure. We know that one of the major anthropogenic activities in the Mara ecosystem is livestock grazing, which influences vegetation structure and community composition. Hares generally inhabit grassland and pastoral ecosystems, so **if habitat suitability for hares is shaped by pastoral activity we might expect a positive relationship with livestock**. Alternatively, **if areas with very high levels of livestock activity are too frequently disturbed to provide amenable habitat, we might expect hare occurrence to decline where livestock pressure is highest**. So here we have two alternative, plausible hypotheses. "
