# Week 10: From AI to Ecological Models

## Instructions

## Google Colab

To run this week's practical on Google Colab, simply click on the following
badge.

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MScEcologyAndDataScienceUCL/BIOS0032_AI4Environment/blob/main/10_AItoEcologicalModels2/AItoEcolMods_wk10.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

This will open a Python notebook, where you can use the rpy2 package to run R
within this environment.

Please run the setup script as soon as possible, as it can take up to 10 minutes
to complete.

## Using Binder

Alternatively, you can run the practical on a cloud instance of Rstudio with all
the required packages pre-installed. To do this, click on the following badge.

<a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MScEcologyAndDataScienceUCL/binder-env/main?urlpath=rstudio&filepath=BIOS0032_AI4Environment/10_AItoEcologicalModels2/AItoEcolMods_wk10.ipynb" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/581c077bdbc6ca6899c86d0acc6145ae85e9d80e6f805a1071793dbe48917982/68747470733a2f2f6d7962696e6465722e6f72672f62616467655f6c6f676f2e737667" alt="launch binder" data-canonical-src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" style="max-width: 100%;"></a>

Here, you will work directly on an Rmarkdown file within Rstudio. However,
please note that the cloud instance is limited to 2GB of RAM, so avoid
performing heavy computations. The instance will reset if you exceed the limit.

## Using your computer

If you prefer to use your own computer and Rstudio, make sure that you have the
following R packages installed. 

```R
install.packages("dplyr");
install.packages("magrittr");
install.packages("tibble")
install.packages("sf");
install.packages("ggplot2");
install.packages("tidyr");
install.packages("mgcv");
install.packages("gratia");
install.packages("lme4")
```

Additionally, download the repository to gain
local access to the data required for today's practical.
