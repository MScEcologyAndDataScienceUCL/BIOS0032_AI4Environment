    "1. Both species have few training examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The training examples might not cover the whole range of call variation. Test calls could contain call types not seen during training. This could be fixed by collecting more data, or generating synthetic data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. In general in unbalanced datasets the classes with least amount of examples will suffer, as the training algorithms bias model parameters to benefit the most frequent classes. This could be fixed by subsampling overrepresented classes or oversampling underrepresented classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Each species has around 70-80 calls in the training dataset. However, we are using a set of 143 features, meaning that any model with sufficient flexibility can fully overfit to the training data. This could be fixed by constraining model flexiblity (modify RF params, or select another model type) or using less features.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. There is substantial overlap between echolocation calls of different species:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. This could be due to errors in labelling. Errors in the annotation process are common and should be expected. This could be fixed by conducting a review process in which suspicious annotations are verified or corrected. An annotation can be flagged as suspicious if its features lies far from the usual distribution (outlier detection), or if the model is confidently wrong about its class (hard example mining).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Bat echolocation calls are are used to navigate and detect pray. If habitual flying space and/or prey are similar for two species they will tend to echolocate in a similar fashion. When this is the case using a different classification scheme for bats, such as one based on ecological traits, might be better suited for the task of acoustic identification.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Sound production is also constrained by morphology. Closely related species will tend to have similar sound production capabilities and thus similar echolocation calls. However, this is not always the case as echolocation call is heavily constrained by ecology (as mentioned in the previous point). A potential workaround is to classify to a higher taxonomic level such as genus or family.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Selected call features cannot discern between species. It could be the case that there are subtle cues in the audio that aid identification but haven't been measured. In this case either more features should be designed and measured, or adopting an approach of automated feature extraction (such as deep learning approaches) could help find a better feature set for acoustic identification."
